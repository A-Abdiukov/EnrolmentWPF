#  College facility management application
### A fully responsive WPF application

Management application with multi-level access system. There are two users, with different levels of access.

Currently the application is connected to a live Azure database. 

The application uses stored procedures only, and contains 47 stored procedures.

The application is built upon the MVC model.

Overall, the application contains 31 windows/forms!

I tried to experiment and used generic methods, where possible.

Contains a navigation bar at the top - to allow for easy navigation.

Additionally, user can right click on any datagrid to select which columns they wish to hide.
